If you want to use a remote host, you have to modify "xshogi.h".
The program "gnushogi" must be known. In case of trouble, create a
symbolic link to the gnushogi distribution , e.g. :

    ln -s $(HOME)/gnushogi-1.3/src/gnushogi gnushogi1

for the first gnushogi program.  If you would like to let
two versions play against each other, establish a similar link
for gnushogi2.
