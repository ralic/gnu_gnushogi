GNU shogi news
--------------

This file will start with GNU Shogi 1.3 (07/01/1999).

Changes in version 1.3 (07/1999):

* xshogi has been merged into the gnushogi source tree and build process.

* gnushogi is now only one executable, instead of three (one each for the raw
  text interface, the xshogi interface, and the curses interface).  The three
  interfaces are still there; you select between them using a command-line
  option: "gnushogi -C" for the curses interface, "gnushogi -R" for the raw
  text interface, and "gnushogi -X" or just "gnushogi" for the xshogi
  interface.  Making the xshogi interface the default makes it easier for
  xshogi to invoke gnushogi (translation: I couldn't be bothered figuring out
  why this was the case, so I just left it that way).

* The gnushogi and xshogi source code has been thoroughly cleaned up and
  ANSIfied.  Several files have been renamed.  Makefiles have also been
  cleaned up considerably, but you don't need to care about this, because... 

* Building GNU shogi and xshogi now uses a configure script generated by
  autoconf.  This should increase portability and make compilation much
  easier. 

* There is now fairly extensive documentation in texinfo form, which has been
  used to generate info, postscript, and html versions of the documentation.
  The man page is included in the texinfo file.  The (separate) man pages have
  been updated to deal with the new command-line options for gnushogi.
