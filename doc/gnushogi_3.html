game... it is at least as interesting."

"... shogi [is] by far the most complex form of chess that has ever
achieved widespread popularity."

Shogi is the version of chess played in Japan.  It is strikingly
different from standard chess (which I shall refer to henceforth as
"international chess") and also to all other regional variants,
because captured pieces can re-enter play on the side of the capturer.
This has several interesting effects on the play of the game:



<OL>
<LI>

Shogi is much more complex than international chess, at least in
terms of the average number of possible moves per turn (estimated at
about 35 for chess and at about 80 for shogi).

<LI>

There are almost no draws (about 1-2% of all games in professional play).

<LI>

Exchanges complicate the play rather than simplifying it.

<LI>

There are no "endgames" in the standard chess sense; all pieces remain
in play throughout the game.  Games typically end in a race to
checkmate the other player before being checkmated oneself.

<LI>

Ownership of a piece is not indicated by the color of the piece;
instead, pieces are wedge-shaped and point towards the opponent.  The
name of the piece is inscribed in Kanji characters on the front of the
piece.

<LI>

Most importantly: it's more fun than other forms of chess :-)

Shogi is extremely popular in Japan; it has been estimated that 20
million Japanese can play shogi, of which perhaps 1 million are active
players.  It is even more popular there than the game of go, Japan's
other favorite board game.  There are a number of professional players
who make a considerable amount of money playing in shogi tournaments,
and the game receives extensive newpaper and television coverage.
Despite this, the game has yet to become popular outside of Japan.  Part
of this is because the Kanji characters on the pieces scare away some
people, but mostly it's due, I think, to lack of exposure to the game
and to the difficulty of finding opponents.  I hope that GNU shogi will
help introduce shogi to a wider audience.
