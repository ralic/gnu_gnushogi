A game of shogi is won by capturing the opponent's king.  In general,
this is done by checkmating the king: attacking the king in such a way
that the king cannot be defended no matter what the defending player
moves.  Note, though, that there is no rule that requires a player to
defend a king which is being attacked.  However, if he does not defend
his king, the opponent is entirely free to capture it on the next move,
thus winning the game.  As in international chess, in practice most
games end by resignation when one player realizes that he cannot escape
checkmate.
