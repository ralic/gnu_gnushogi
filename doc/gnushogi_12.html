<H3><A NAME="SEC15">Notes for chess players</A></H3>

<P>
Here are a few miscellaneous things that may confuse chess players.
Some of these have been mentioned elsewhere, but they bear repeating.



<OL>
<LI>There is no queen.

<LI>Pawns capture the same way they move.  There is no initial

two-space pawn move and no <EM>en-passant</EM> move.

<LI>There is no special castling move.  There <EM>are</EM> a large

number of possible defensive formations referred to as "castles"
(see section <A HREF="gnushogi_13.html#SEC16">Sample game</A>) but there is no need for special moves to create
them.

<LI>A given piece can only promote to <EM>one</EM> other kind of piece.
