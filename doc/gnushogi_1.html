<P>
GNU shogi is a program that plays shogi, the Japanese version of chess,
against a human (or computer) opponent.  This file describes how to use
GNU shogi and also gives background information about the game of shogi.


<P>
This file describes GNU shogi version 1.3.  It was written by me, Mike
Vanier, the current maintainer of GNU shogi.  My email address is
<A HREF="mailto:mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu">mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu</A>.


<P>
GNU shogi is actually two programs: 


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`gnushogi'</SAMP>
<DD>
is the text-based program which also contains the game-playing engine.

<DT><SAMP>`xshogi'</SAMP>
<DD>
is the X-windows graphical interface to gnushogi.

</DL>

<P>
Since xshogi invokes gnushogi, most players will just type "xshogi"
and start playing.


<P>
Disclaimer: I use the personal pronouns "him", "his" etc. to refer
to a shogi player regardless of gender.  That's easier than writing
"his or her" all over the place.  I don't mean to infer that women
don't play shogi; in fact shogi is very popular in Japan among women as
well as men.
