<P>

<P>
In sharp contrast to international chess, where only pawns can promote
to higher-ranked pieces, most of the pieces in shogi can promote.  The
promoted ranks are discussed in the section on piece moves (see section <A HREF="gnushogi_5.html#SEC8">The moves of the pieces</A>) but are repeated here for reference:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Pawn
<DD>
promotes to gold general (called a `tokin' in this case only).

<DT>Lance
<DD>
promotes to gold general.

<DT>Knight
<DD>
promotes to gold general.

<DT>Silver general
<DD>
promotes to gold general.

<DT>Gold general
<DD>
does not promote.

<DT>Bishop
<DD>
promotes to "dragon horse" or just "horse" for short.  The horse can
move as a bishop or can move one square in any orthogonal direction.

<DT>Rook
<DD>
promotes to "dragon king" or just "dragon" for short.  The dragon
can move as a rook or can move one square in any diagonal direction.

<DT>King
<DD>
does not promote.

</DL>

<P>
The three ranks furthest away from each player constitute his/her
"promotion zone".  A player may, but is not required to, promote a
piece after making a move in which the piece begins and/or ends in the
promotion zone.  Thus you can promote a piece when moving the piece into
the promotion zone, out of the promotion zone, or entirely within the
promotion zone.  Promotion is mandatory in these cases:



<OL>

<LI>You must promote a pawn or a lance after moving it to the last rank.

<LI>You must promote a knight after moving it to either of the last

two ranks.

</OL>

<P>
These forced promotions ensure that a piece cannot be moved to a square
from which it would have no further move.


<P>
Pieces "dropped" onto the board (see section <A HREF="gnushogi_8.html#SEC11">Drops</A>) always drop in the
unpromoted state, even if they drop into the promotion zone.
