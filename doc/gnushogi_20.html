<P>
I would like to thank the following people:



<UL>

<LI>

Matthias Mutz, who originally developed GNU shogi as a spin-off of GNU
chess and who very kindly let me take over the maintenance of this very
interesting project.

<LI>

Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, for creating an
organization where anyone can contribute software for the common good of
all, for making GNU/Linux possible, and especially for writing emacs and
gcc, without which my working life would be intolerable.

<LI>

Georges Hodges, for starting the Shogi Association in England, without
which I would probably never have heard of shogi, for supplying shogi
equipment, for publishing the excellent magazine "Shogi" (now sadly
defunct), for personally answering all my silly questions by mail, and
for being the ambassador of shogi to the West.

<LI>

Pieter Stouten, for having the most comprehensive shogi site on the
World Wide Web <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/stouten/shogi.html">http://www.halcyon.com/stouten/shogi.html</A>, and for
maintaining the shogi-l mailing list.  Go to Pieter's web site for more
information on subscribing to the list.  Also thanks to everyone who
contributes and has contributed to that list.

<LI>

Matt Casters, for testing GNU shogi.  Matt and I will be working
together on improving the solution engine in future versions of this
program.
