<P>
The motto of GNU shogi is "100% bug-free or you don't pay!" :-)  In the
extremely unlikely case (*ahem*) that you do find a bug, please send me
(Mike Vanier) an email at <A HREF="mailto:mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu">mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu</A>.  Also, feel
free to send me comments, complaints, out-and-out raves, suggestions,
plane tickets to Hawaii, and/or large suitcases filled with unmarked,
untraceable hundred-dollar bills.
