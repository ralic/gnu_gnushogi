<P>
Unlike international chess, shogi has a well-established handicap system
which is used when players of different strengths play against each
other.  Handicaps range from small to huge, which makes it possible for
weak players to play against even very strong players and have an even
chance of winning.


<P>
Shogi players are ranked as follows: the weakest rank is around 15
"kyu", which represents a beginner.  14 kyu is higher than 15 kyu, 13
kyu is higher still, and so on until you get to 1 kyu.  The next highest
rank is 1 "dan", followed by 2 dan, 3 dan and so forth.  The highest
amateur rank is 6 dan; professionals go up to 9 dan.  However,
professional ranks are not the same as amateur ranks; a professional 1
dan is <EM>much</EM> stronger than an amateur 1 dan.  This system is
similar to that used by go players (and also other Japanese sports such
as karate).


<P>
A handicap consists of the stronger player playing White and removing
one or more pieces from his side of the board at the start of the game.
These pieces are permanently removed from play; they are not in hand.


<P>
The following is a list of the accepted handicaps, from weakest to
strongest.  The degree of the handicap, represented by the position in
the list, represents the difference in rank between the two players for
which the handicap is appropriate.  These rules are taken from the books
"Shogi for Beginners" by John Fairbairn and "The Art of Shogi" by
Tony Hoskings (see section <A HREF="gnushogi_19.html#SEC22">References and links</A>) and, I believe, represent
current Japanese practice.



<OL>

<LI>

The stronger player removes his left lance (on 1a).

<LI>

The players play a two-game match; in the first game the stronger player
removes his left lance (on 1a), while in the second game he removes his
bishop.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his bishop.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his rook.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his rook and left lance.

<LI>

The players play a two-game match; in the first game the stronger player
removes his rook and left lance (on 1a), while in the second game he
removes his rook and bishop.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his rook and bishop.  This is usually called
a "two-piece" handicap.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his rook, bishop, and both lances.  This is
called a "four-piece" handicap.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his rook, bishop, both lances, and both
knights.  This is called a "six-piece" handicap.

<LI>

The stronger player removes his rook, bishop, both lances, both knights,
and both silvers.  This is called an "eight-piece" handicap.

</OL>

<P>
Another advantage of playing handicap games is that the handicaps alter
the optimal strategy for both players.  For instance, handicaps all have
their own opening lines which may bear little or no resemblance to those
used in non-handicap shogi.  This means that when learning handicap
shogi, you are essentially learning completely new games which use the
same equipment!


<P>
The reader may wonder how on earth a player giving an eight-piece
handicap, say, could possibly hope to win.  Don't forget, though, that
in shogi the opponent's pieces can be captured and then become part of
one's own army.  Thus, if the opponent plays badly enough, the number of
pieces will soon even out.
