GNU Shogi, release 1.3
----------------------

This is release 1.3 of GNU shogi, a program which plays shogi (Japanese
chess), as well as xshogi, the graphical interface to GNU shogi.  GNU shogi
and xshogi were originally written by Matthias Mutz (mutz@fmi.uni-passau.de),
but are now maintained by me, Mike Vanier (mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu).  GNU
shogi was in turn based on GNU Chess 4.0, i.e. the first version of GNU Shogi
was obtained by "simply" modifying the chess-specific parts of GNU Chess 4.0.
We would like to thank the authors of GNU Chess 4.0 for making the sources of
that program available.  I would also like to thank Matthias for allowing me
to take over the maintenance of this project.

See the file NEWS for the new features of this release.

For the installation procedure read the file "INSTALL".  For more information
on shogi please look at the files in the doc directory or read the info file.

Please email bugs, comments, suggestions, and wish lists regarding GNU shogi
to me.  And enjoy the program :-)

Mike Vanier (mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu)
