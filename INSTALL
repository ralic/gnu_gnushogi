Installation procedure for GNU Shogi
------------------------------------

1. edit src/Makefile. For setting the paths, normally only
   HOME or LIBDIR and BINDIR need to be changed. Setting CC
   and CFLAGS sets C compiler and compiler options.

2. type 'make gnushogir' to create plain dumb-terminal shogi.

3. type 'make gnushogi.bbk' to create the binary book file.

4. OPTIONAL:
   type 'make gnushogi' to create cursed based shogi            

5. OPTIONAL:
   type 'make gnushogix' to create xshogi based shogi. You may
   use GNU XShogi as an X Windows based graphical interface to
   GNU Shogi. GNU XShogi also supports the Internet Shogi 
   Server (ISS).

6. type 'make install' to copy the binary book file to the libraries
   destination directory and to copy the gnushogi* executables to
   the binaries destination directory.

7. OPTIONAL:
   type 'make clean' to remove objects from destination source
   directory.
