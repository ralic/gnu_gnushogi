Changes of XShogi will are recorded starting with XShogi 1.0 patchlevel 10.

version 1.3 

01.06.1999
    o New maintainer: Mike Vanier (mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu).

    o Merged xshogi into the gnushogi source tree.
      Henceforth, further revisions of xshogi will be noted in the
      top-level NEWS file; this file will not be added to.

    o Cleaned up the source code and Makefile.

    o Changed the code to refer to "gnushogi" instead
      of "gnushogix" since gnushogi now is only
      one executable, and the default input/output
      format is the xshogi format.

    o Removed support for Internet Shogi Server (ISS);
      there are now better ways to play shogi over the internet
      such as JavaShogi, so this support was redundant.

   Correction of the "save game" command. Now, games saved with this

   install on different machines.

   Changing "bitmaps" to "eastern_bitmaps" and adding the more chess-like
   pieces from Paul Reines as "western_bitmaps". This forces minor
   changes in xshogi.c.
