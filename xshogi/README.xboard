XBoard is an X11/R4-based user interface for GNU Chess.  It uses the R4 Athena
widgets and Xt Intrinsics to provide an interactive referee for managing a
chess game between a user and a computer opponent or between two computers.
You can also use XBoard without a chess program to play through games in files
or to play through games manually (force mode); in this case, moves aren't
validated by XBoard.  XBoard manages a digital chess clock for each player and
resets the clocks if the proper number of moves are played within the time
control period.  A game can be started with the initial chess position, with a
series of moves from a game file or with a position from a position file.  The
"match" shell script runs a series of games between two machines, alternating
sides.  The man page xboard.man describes the features of XBoard.

XBoard was originally written by Dan Sears and Chris Sears.  XBoard borrows its
colors, icons and piece bitmaps from XChess, which was written and copyrighted
by Wayne Christopher.  We thank him for his work on XChess.  Beginning with
version 2.0, Tim Mann has taken over development of XBoard.

Cracraft <cracraft@rice-chex.ai.mit.edu>.  If you improve XBoard, please send
your changes to Tim and Stuart.

CAVEATS

XBoard depends on the R4 Xt Intrinsics and R4 Athena Widget Set.  In
particular, R3 just won't do---XBoard uses features introduced in R4.  The
standard DEC and SUN releases won't do either.  The Athena widgets are either
missing in the DEC standard distribution or in the wrong (R3) place in SUN
OpenWindows.

XBoard works best with version 4.0 of GNU Chess.  (Older versions may also
work, but they are unsupported.  The GNU Chess project requests that you get a
current copy of GNU Chess rather than using older, bug-ridden versions.)  GNU
Chess must be compiled with the -DXBOARD flag for use with XBoard.  Use the
"make gnuchessx" target in GNU Chess 4.0 to do this.

The Free Software Foundation would prefer to be able to distribute an X
chessboard program covered only by the GNU General Public License and
unencumbered by any other copyright.  If you can help with this, please 
contact the FSF.
